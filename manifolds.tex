\textbf{Motivation:} Some problems occur with our definition of curves and surfaces:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The sphere is not a surface because no regular parametrisation  (harry (Potter? WTF Jojo?) ball theorem)
	\item The hyperbola is no a surface, because it has two components thus it can not be parametrised by a single regular map on an open interval.
\end{itemize}

The notion of a submanifold resolves these problems at the expense of imposing other restrictions.

\section{Submanifolds of $\E^n$}
There are several equivalent characterisations of submanifolds in $\E^n$.

\begin{definition}[1. A submanifols can be locally flattened]
	$M \subset \E^n$ is called a $k$-dimensional submanifold of $\E^n$ if for all $p \in M$ there exists a diffeomorphism $\phi: U \to \tilde U$, where $U \subset \E^n$ is an open neighbourhood of $p$ and $\tilde U \subset \R^n$ is an open neighbourhood of $0$ such that
		\[ \phi(M \cap U)= \tilde U \cap (\R^k \times \{0\}), \]
	where $\R^n = \R^k \oplus \R^{n-k}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[2. A submanifold is locally a level set]
	$M \subset \E^n$ is a $k$-dimensional submanifold of $\E^n$ if for all $p \in M$ there exist open neighbourhood $U \subset \E^n$ of $p$ and a submersion $F. U \to \R^{n-k}$ such that
		\[ M \cap U = F^{-1}\{0\}. \]
	Where $dpF: \R^n \to \R^{n-k}$ surjects for all $p \in U$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	In the definition above th is sufficient to require that $dpF: \R^n \to \R^{n-k}$ surjects: if $dpF$ surjects then since $p \mapsto dpF$ is continuous, $dpF$ surjects by the inertia principle on some open neighbourhood $\tilde U \subset U$ of $p$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[3. A submanifold can be locally parametrised]
	$M \subset \E^n$ is a $k$-dimensional submanifold of $\E^n$ if for all $p \in M$ there exists an immersion $X: V \to U$ from an open neighbourhood $V \subset \R^k$ of $0$ to an open neighbourhood $U \subset \E^n$ of $p$ such that
		\[ M \cap U = X(V) \]
	and $X:V \to M \cap U$ is a homeomorphism (with respect to the induced topology on $M \cap U$).
	
	A homeomorphism is continuous and bijective.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $X$ being an immersion excludes ''kinks'' such as the singularity of the nilparabola.
		\item $X$ being injective excludes self intersections.
		\item Continuity of $X^{-1}$ excludes ''T-junctions''.
	\end{itemize}
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
	Proof of equivalence of these definitions:
	
	For $\R^n = \R^k \oplus \R^{n-k}$ we define the submersions
		\[ \pi_1: \R^k \oplus \R^{n-k} \to \R^k, (x,y) \mapsto x, \]
		\[ \pi_2: \R^k \oplus \R^{n-k} \to \R^k, (x,y) \mapsto y. \]
	First we proof $1.$ implies $2.$:
	
	Let $F:= \pi_2 \circ \phi: U \to \R^{n-k}$. $F$ is a submersion.
	
	Secondly we proof $1.$ implies $3.$:
	
	With $V= \pi_1(\tilde U) \subset \R^k$ we can have
		\[ X:= \phi^{-1}\big|_v: V \to U \]
	is the necessary map.
	If you are bored, you can check that this is an homeomorphism.
	
	Now we proof $3.$ implies $1.$:
	
	Let $X: \R^k \supset V \to \E^n$ parametrisation of $M \cap U = X(V)$. Assume that $X(0)= p$. Let $(t_1, \ldots,t_{n-k})$ be an orthonormal basis of $d_0X(\R^k)^\perp \subset \R^n$. Define
		\[ C \times \R^{n-k}: (x,y) \mapsto \psi(x,y)= X(x)+ \sum_{i=1}^{n-k} t_iy_i, \quad y=(y_1,\ldots,y_{n-k}). \]
	Then 
		\[ d_0\psi(v,w) = \underbrace{d_0X(v)}_{\in d_0X(\R^k)} + \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^{n-k} t_i w_i}_{\in (d_0X(\R^k))^\perp} = 0 \]
	iff $w_i=0$ for all $i$ and $v=0$ or $(v,w)=0$. 
	
	Then we use the inverse mapping theorem, $\psi$ has a smooth local inverse
		\[ \phi=(\psi\big|_{\tilde U})^{-1}: \psi(\tilde U) \to \tilde U \]
	where $\tilde U \subset V \times \R^k$ open neighbourhood of $0$. Without loss of generality, assume that $\psi(\tilde U) \subset U$ (otherwise take the intersection with U).
	Now, $q \in M \cap \psi(\tilde U)$ implies there exists a $x \in V$ such that $q= X(x)= \psi(x,0) \in \psi(\tilde U)$. On the other hand 
		\[ (x,0) \in \tilde U \Rightarrow \psi(x,0) = X(x) \in M \]
	with means that $q=X(x) \in M \cap \psi(\tilde U)$.
	
	After replacing $\psi(\tilde U)$ with $U$, then $\phi(U \cap M)= \tilde U \cap (\R^k \times \{0\})$.
	
	2. $\Rightarrow$ 1. $ F: U \rightarrow \R^{n-k} $ submersion. Let $ t_1, \dots ,t_n $ be an orthonormal basis of $ \R^n $ such that $ t_1,\dots,t_k $ is an orthonormal basis of $\mathrm{ker} d_pF$. Write $  \R^{n} = \skal{e_1,\dots,e_k} \oplus \R^{n-k} $ then $ q \in U \Rightarrow q = p + \sum_{i = 1}^{n}t_iq_i $ and 
		\[ \phi: U \rightarrow \R^n \quad, \quad \phi(q) = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} e_iq_i + F(q) \]
		\[d_p\phi (v) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}e_iv_i + d_pF(v) = 0 \text{ for } v = \sum_{i = 1}^{k}t_iv_i\] is equivalent to
		$d_pF(v) = 0$ and thus $ v \in \mathrm{ker}d_pF $
		and also to
		\[ \sum_{i=1}^{k}e_iv_i = 0 \text{ thus } \forall i v_i = 0 \Leftrightarrow v = 0 \] 
		Thus $ d_p\phi $ is invertable and by the Inverse Mapping Theorem
			\[ \phi : U \rightarrow \phi(U) \text{ is a diffeomorphism (maybe after shrinking $U$)}. \]
		Now, $ q \in M \cap U \Leftrightarrow F(q) = 0 \Leftrightarrow \phi(q) \in \phi(U) \cap ( \R^k \times \{0\} ) $.
		Thus $ \phi(M \cap U) = \phi(U) \cap (R^k \times \{0\}) $
\end{proof}  

\begin{example}
	\begin{enumerate} The following are manifolds:
		\item Plane: $ \pi = \{ p \in \E^3 : \skal{p-O,n} = d \} $
		$ F : \E^3 \rightarrow \R, F(q) = \skal{p-O,n}-d $ then $ \pi = f^{-1}(\{0\}) $.
		Also, $ d_pF(v) = \skal{v,n} $ and hence $ d_pF \not \equiv 0 $. Thus $ d_pF $ surjects and $F$ is a submersion.
		
		\item Sphere: $ S = \{ p \in \E^3 ~|~ \skal{p-O,p-O} = r^2 \} $ and $ S $ is implicitly given by the function $ F : \E^3 \rightarrow \R, F(p) = \skal{p-O,p-O}-r^2 $. Here $ d_pF(v) = 2 \skal{v,p-O} $ and $ d_pF $ surjects as long as $p \not \equiv 0$ which does not happen in $ S $.
		$ F\big|_{\E^3 \setminus \{ 0 \} } $ is a submersion.
		
		\item  Hyperboloids: $O + e_1x + e_2y + e_3z$ such that
	 $ F_\pm(O  + e_1x + e_2y + e_3z) = 0 $ where  $ F_\pm(O  + e_1x + e_2y + e_3z) = (\dfrac{x}{a})^2 + (\dfrac{y}{b})^2 +(\dfrac{z}{c})^2 \pm 1 $
	 $\nabla F = 2(e_1 \dfrac{x}{a^2} + e_2 \dfrac{y}{b^2} + e_3 \dfrac{z}{c^2})$ Then $ \nabla F = 0 \Leftrightarrow (x,y,z) = 0 $. Therefore $ F\big|_{\E^3 \setminus \{0\}} $ is a submersion. $\skal{\nabla F,v}= dF(v)$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	A counterexample is the following \emph{Lemniscate}.
	$ O + e_1x + e_2y $, where $ x^4 - x^2 + y^2 = 0 $. A regular parametrization is given by $ t \mapsto O + e_1 x(t) + e_2 y(t) = O + e_1 \sin(t) + e_2\sin(t)\cos(t). $ 
	The curve has a self-intersection at $ (x(t),y(t))=(0,0) $ which is equivalent to $ \forall k \in \mathbb{Z} t = k\pi $. Hence this is not a $ 1$-Dimensional submanifold.
